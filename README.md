# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts diabetes using machine learning. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is analyzed with visualizations, features are standardized, and a Logistic Regression model is trained to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. Model accuracy, confusion matrix, and sample predictions demonstrate performance.
